# JS-Flow-1-period-1-hand-in

Note: This description is too big for a single exam-question. It will be divided up into several questions for the exam
Explain and Reflect:
•	Explain the differences between Java and JavaScript. You should include both topics related to the fact that Java is a compiled language and JavaScript a scripted language, and general differences in language features.
-	Both are OOP languages, but java is a OOP programing language while JavaScript is a OOP scripting language. Java runs on a virtual machine and browser. While JS only runs in a browser. Java is considered a compiled programming language. JavaScript is considered an interpreted scripting language. And ofc the syntax differensses.
•	Explain the two strategies for improving JavaScript: ES6 (es2015) + ES7, versus Typescript. What does it require to use these technologies: In our backend with Node and in (many different) Browsers
-	With typescript you get the newest ES versions.
•	Explain generally about node.js, when it “makes sense” and npm, and how it “fits” into the node echo system.
-	node is an open-source runtime environment that execute JS code outside of the browser. We use node in real-time application, when we want to modify code live(run-time).
•	Explain about the Event Loop in Node.js
-	Event looping allows node to perform non-blocking I/O operations. Despite the fact thatJS is single-threaded
•	Explain (some) of the purposes with the tools Babel and WebPack, using  examples from the exercises
-	Babel is a JS compiler that is used in web development. Babel allows the programmer to code in the preferred programing language, and have it translated by babel inti JS.
-	Webpack main purpose is to bundle JS files for usage in a browser. 

Explain using sufficient code examples the following features in JavaScript.   

•	Variable/function-Hoisting 

https://github.com/Ficko05/JS-Flow-1-period-1-hand-in/blob/master/variableHoisting.js  

•	Function Closures and the JavaScript Module Pattern 

https://github.com/Ficko05/JS-Flow-1-period-1-hand-in/blob/master/closuresModulePattern.js  

•	Immediately-Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE)

•	JavaScripts Prototype

https://github.com/Ficko05/JS-Flow-1-period-1-hand-in/blob/master/protoType.js 

•	User-defined Callback Functions (writing your own functions that take a callback)

https://github.com/Ficko05/JS-Flow-1-period-1-hand-in/blob/master/callback.js 

•	Explain the methods map, filter and reduce

https://github.com/Ficko05/JS-Flow-1-period-1-hand-in/blob/master/mapFilterReduce.js 

•	Provide examples of user-defined reusable modules implemented in Node.js

https://github.com/Ficko05/JS-Flow-1-period-1-hand-in/blob/master/closuresModulePattern.js 

 
ES6,7,8... and TypeScript

•	Provide examples and explain the es2015 features: let, arrow functions, this, rest parameters, de-structuring assignments, maps/sets etc.
•	Explain and demonstrate how es2015 supports modules (import and export) similar to what is offered by NodeJS.
•	Provide an example of ES6 inheritance and reflect over the differences between Inheritance in Java and in ES6.
•	Provide examples with es-next, running in a browser, using Babel and Webpack
•	Provide a number of examples to demonstrate the benefits of using TypeScript, including, types, interfaces, classes and generics
•	Explain the ECMAScript Proposal Process for how new features are added to the language (the TC39 Process)
Callbacks, Promises and async/await

Explain about promises in ES-6 including, the problems they solve, a quick explanation of the Promise API and:
•	Example(s) that demonstrate how to avoid the callback hell  (“Pyramid of Doom")
•	Example(s) that demonstrate how to execute asynchronous (promise-based) code in serial or parallel
•	Example(s) that demonstrate how to implement our own promise-solutions.
•	Example(s) that demonstrate error handling with promises

Explain about JavaScripts async/await, how it relates to promises and reasons to use it compared to the plain promise API.

Provide examples to demonstrate 
Why this often is the preferred way of handling promises
Error handling with async/await
Serial or parallel execution with async/await.
